## _Long COVID Research Web Development Team Repository_

This repository holds the code that creates the website for the Long COVID Research Web Development Team. The website is built under the structure of NextJS. 

## Purpose
The Long COVID data repository is a public, open source data repository that contains anonymized data related to the social and demographic impacts of Long COVID. The repository includes both qualitative and quantitative data, collected through surveys, interviews, and web scraping. The data has been contributed by various individuals and organizations, and has been subjected to data cleaning and validation to ensure accuracy and consistency. The repository is intended to support research and analysis of Long COVID, and to inform public health efforts to address the long-term impacts of COVID-19.

## Our Thesis
The lack of access to quality medical and health services, coupled with inadequate information and education about Long Covid has resulted in a public health crisis disproportionately affecting Latino communities in Eastern Washington, particularly those from low-income and rural backgrounds. This crisis is further exacerbated by a shortage of medical infrastructure, mistrust of the government, and limited financial assistance for medical treatments. To address this issue, there needs to be a comprehensive government intervention and policy reform that addresses these underlying issues and provides resources for training in the assessment and treatment of Long COVID and increasing the number of Spanish-speaking providers in Eastern Washington. To meet the needs of communities impacted by Long Covid, community-based organizations need to be empowered with education about the illness and research-driven plans for assistance.
